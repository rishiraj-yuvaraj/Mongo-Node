# Mongo-Node
Hello, Please have a look on my Mongodb, Node backend code.
Also I used this same code for 4 frontend urls.
I used this as a template for all other apps as well.
Final one i did webcode project and i named the code as webcode routes & services in src.


## Capstone Project - Backend
I have used this code to create Capstone project as well.
I used Post and Get for this API's.
I used only index.js file for this Capstone project.
I started my code from line.No.197 and i used mongo db for the database storage.
I used the port to connect as 4000 to the backend server.
I used post method to send data to db and I used get method to get the data from db.
I used different collections for my database in capstone project.
